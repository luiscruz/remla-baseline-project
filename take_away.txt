Use a random seed to train the model and then test the accuracy
Maybe after several experiments we have values and we can show them.    --> Clear later (We could show the quality of the code?)
We have to do the data validation as well.
Don't develop kubernetes deployment if it is not necessary.
Try the github stuff first for the actions.
Implement the TF-IDF to see how it works
See the distribution of the labels in the input data and output data    --> Data validation (vs is the accuracy)
